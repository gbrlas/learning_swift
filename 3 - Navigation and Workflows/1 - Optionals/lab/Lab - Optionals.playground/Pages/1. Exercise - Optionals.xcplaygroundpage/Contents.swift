 ## Exercise - Optionals

 Imagine you have an app that asks the user to enter his/her age using the keyboard. When your app allows a user the input text, what is captured for you is given as a `String`. However, you want to store this information as an `Int`. Is it possible for the user to make a mistake and for the input to not match the type you want to store?
 
 Declare a constant `userInputAge` of type `String` and assign it "34e" to simulate a typo while typing age. Then declare a constant `userAge` of type `Int` and use the `Int` initializer and pass in `userInputAge`. What error do you get?
*/
var userInputAge = "34"
var userAge: Int?
userAge = Int(userInputAge)

/*:
 Go back and change the type of `userAge` to `Int?`, and print the value of `userAge`. Why is `userAge`'s value `nil`? Provide your answer in a comment or print statement below.
 */


/*:
 Now go back and fix the typo on `userInputAge`. Is there anything about the value printed that seems off?
 
 Print `userAge` again, but this time unwrap `userAge` using the bang operator.
 */
print(userAge!)

/*:
 Now use optional binding to unwrap `userAge`. If `userAge` has a value, print it to the console.
 */
if let age = userAge {
    print(age)
}
